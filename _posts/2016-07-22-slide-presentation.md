title: slide presentation with video
----

We were interested in waking up the classroom and having some fun at the same time. We were also learning to use reveal.js and audacity. The theme was the Do's and Don'ts to microwave cooking!   We used slides with pictures of various foods imploding and one video for lasting effect. This was a fun way of completeing the task!
