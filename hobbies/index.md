I love spending time in the flowers! I could spend hours if allowed.I prefer planting flowers that are native to my state. My prefered style of flower bed design is the cottage garden. 
I also love to read books - not electronic books - but real books that you feel in your hands and hear the pages turning as you go. It is if the bookis speaking to you. Need I say more ?
